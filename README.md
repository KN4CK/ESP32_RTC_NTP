# ESP32_RTC_NTP
Arduino program to update the DS3231 RTC from an NTP server on an ESP32

I wanted to update the DS3231 RTC for a project and didn't find a program to do so. So I made this thing.

## Tested using
* ESP32-S2-Saola-1
* [Aideepen DS3231SN RTC Module](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07WJZ7NKM/)
